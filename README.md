This project is built on **React** + **Node.js** technologies.
**Frontend:** *React.js.*
**Hooks used:** *useState*, *useEffect*, *useNavigate*, *useSearchParams*. 
The client side of the application performs its basic function of displaying and styling information in a way that is comfortable for the user, as well as providing a comfortable search for recipes.
**Backend:** *Node.js*, *express.js*, *express-validators*, *apiLimiters*. 
The server part provides work with data, their collection, analysis and structuring. Due to the last mentioned technologies it also has limitations up to 50 requests per minute from the same IP, and protection from different types of data that can be sent to the server.
